/**
 * Disable Plugins
 * 
 * One of WordPress' biggest bottlenecks is that it loads every single plugin 
 * that is active on your WordPress installation on every single post/page no
 * matter whether they are needed for that post/page or not. This plugin will
 * allow you to create simple rewrite rules to exclude a plugin or plugins from
 * any URI pattern match. This is a great way to reduce the memory footprint,
 * SQL queries run at page load, load times, and improve site response speed.
 * 
 * Create a /wp-content/mu-plugins/disable-plugins-rules directory if the plugin
 * has not created one for you already. Create a rules file for each site your
 * WordPress installation is running, naming the file after the host name for
 * the site followed by a .rules extension. For example mywordpresssite.com.rules
 * would be a rules set for mywordpresssite.com.
 * 
 * Populate your rules using regular expression pattern matches and plugin base
 * names on each line of your rules file. For example, to exclude the "Hello Dolly"
 * and "Akisment" plugins from being loaded on your home page, you would write 
 * a rules file that looks like:
 * 
 * # Prevent the Hello Dolly plugin from loading on the home page
 * ^\/$ hello
 * # Prevent the Akisment plugin from loading on the home page
 * ^\/$ akismet
 * 
 * You will need to write a rule for each plugin that will be excluded for each
 * pattern that you wish to exclude that plugin from. C style comments are 
 * allowed in your rules file to document your rules.
