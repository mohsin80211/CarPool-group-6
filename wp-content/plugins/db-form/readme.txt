Simple plugIn to submit entries to a database.

== Description ==

__Description:__ <br />
This is just a simple plugIn to submit values to a specific mySQL database.

You can use this plugIn as a contact form which will save the values additionally in a database. <br />
Another way to use this plugIn is as a survey which saves the user's answer. <br />
I already used the plugIn as a competition form.

You can configure the plugIn to either add the given values to a mySQL database
or to send those values to a specific e-mail address.

__Additional features are:__

* Confirmation mail
* Custom mail subjects
* Custom mail messages
* Custom message after form is submitted
* Custom stylesheet selection

Please make sure to read the [documentation](http://www.valentinalisch.de/dev_wp/db-form/ "db-form documentation") before using the plugIn.<br />
It is important.
